The first song on Trippie Redd’s album is named “Leray” and it’s pretty clear that it was obviously dedicated to Coi Leray.</p><p>In a now-deleted tweet from Immortalized on DJ Akademiks’ Instagram account, Coi Leray responded to Trippi’s crystal clear call out and here is what she had to say;</p><p>“It was certainly a b*tch move for Trip to go and name the song after me,” she wrote. “I heard all those songs 5 months ago. And he personally sent me Leray like a b*tch and still puts it in his album.”</p><p>Trippie is yet to respond to Coi Leray’s comments on his song. He did, however, prove that he still feels very possessive over Coi, and even revealed some very private matters between the two of them on Instagram live before she tweeted her response to the song.</p><p>While calling out rapper Lil Gotit for flirting with Coi in her IG comments, Trippie revealed that he got Coi pregnant and that she had an abortion while they were together, even referring to her as his “ex-baby mama.” It’s quite likely that Coi was not pleased by this, which may be why she felt the need to express her feelings about “Leray” to the public.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=you-can-also-read-about-megan-thee-stallion></span>You Can Also Read About Megan Thee Stallion<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=coi-leray-outfits-coi-leray-clothing></span><span>Coi Leray Outfits: Coi Leray Clothing</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>You can check out Coi’s cool and fresh outfits on both her Instagram and her pinterest pins.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=coi-leray-lyrics></span><span>Coi Leray Lyrics</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>You can view and listen to all her song lyrics here.
