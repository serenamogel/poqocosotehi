The movie released in theaters on November 22, 2023. Jodie Comer was originally cast as Josephine, the wife of Napoleon, but Kirby took over the role after Comer dropped out due to scheduling conflicts. Kirby and Phoenix agreed to surprise each other and go to dark places during filming so that their performances would avoid the usual clichés of period dramas. This led to an unscripted moment in which Phoenix slapped Kirby during a divorce scene, a decision that drew considerable media attention.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">The True Story of Napoleon</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=41 title="Personal Life " data-anchor-id=personal-life class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Personal Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Kirby is not married, though she has reportedly dated several fellow actors over the years, including Callum Turner, Douglas Booth, and Paul Rabil.</p><h2 data-node-id=43 title=Quotes data-anchor-id=quotes class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quotes</h2><ul data-node-id=44 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>I never thought that stunts and action would be my genre, but I’m understanding now that you can transcend genre, as long as you try and find the real woman behind the part.</li><li>We women have got to be the generators of the material, and in order to do that, we have to understand the system we’re in, which I’m really trying to do.</li><li>I don’t want to be shot through a lens of sexualization.
