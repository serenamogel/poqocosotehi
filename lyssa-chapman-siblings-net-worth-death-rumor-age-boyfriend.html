when she lost her sister Barbara in a car accident, reports said her sister had died from her injuries.&nbsp;She admitted that it had affected her a lot.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Lyssa Chapman Death Rumor</span></strong></h2><p><span>In September 2012, it was reported that LyssaChapman was involved in a serious car accident in Honolulu and she was with her daughters.&nbsp;However, there were no reports of the extent of the injuries at this time but apparently they lived through it and it was a scary time for the family as they also lost their sister Barbara in a car accident .</span></p><p><span>Her mother told TMZ: “Little Lyssa had an accident and all of our girls were in the car.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGikqajAonnCoZippZGjerS1waWgp5%2BjYrumwIywpqusmGKxpq3ToWSrrZ2kv26txp5km6epm7%2Bqsc2dZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./where-is-bukayo-saka-originally-from-465517-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where is Bukayo Saka originally from?">&larr;
