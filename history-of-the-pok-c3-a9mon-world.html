According to <a href=# title="Spiritomb (Pokémon)">Spiritomb</a>'s Pokédex entry in <a href=# title="Pokémon Diamond and Pearl Versions">Pokémon Pearl</a> and <a href=# title="Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl">Shining Pearl</a>, it is said it was bound in an <a href=# title="Odd Keystone">Odd Keystone</a> 500 years ago, while <a href=# title=Vessa>Vessa</a> states in Legends: Arceus that Spiritomb was sealed hundreds of years ago, making the game take place at most 300 years prior to Diamond, Pearl, Brilliant Diamond, and Shining Pearl.</li></ul>Porygon's creation<p><a href=# title="Porygon (Pokémon)">Porygon</a>'s Pokédex entries in Pokémon Sun, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon state that it was created 20 years ago.<a href=#>[note 5]</a> <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Pocket Monsters Encyclopedia">Pocket Monsters Encyclopedia</a> states that Porygon was created in 1995, as well as stating that 150 species of Pokémon have been discovered as of 1996, alluding to the <a href=# title="Player character">player</a> having completed their <a href=# title=Pokédex>Pokédex</a> in Pokémon Red and Green,<a href=#>[note 6]</a> thus implying that Pokémon Red and Green take place in either 1995 or 1996. This would mean that Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon take place 19–20 years after Pokémon Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow; from this information and the time lengths between other games in the series, it can be calculated that the time period between <a href=# title="Generation II">Generation II</a>/<a href=# title="Generation IV">IV</a> and Pokémon Black and White is 12–13 years long. However, the length of this time gap has never been explicitly confirmed in any official material, with Toshinobu Matsumiya having described it as "secret" on Twitter.<a href=#>[3]</a></p>Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire<p>Although Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire are remakes of Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, they contain some references to features from the original games as having been present about a decade ago,<a href=#>[note 7]</a> while others have not yet come about, such as the <a href=# title="Battle Frontier (Generation III)">Battle Frontier</a>, which is under construction. Despite this, the remakes are implied to happen at the same point in the timeline as the original games, as the <a href=# title="Royal Unova">Royal Unova</a> and a device to visually reproduce the dreams of Pokémon having not yet been created reveals them to take place before Pokémon Black and White<a href=#>[note 8]</a><a href=#>[note 9]</a> and <a href=# title="Mr. Bonding">Mr. Bonding</a> gaining <a href=# title=O-Power>O-Powers</a> reveals them to take place before Pokémon X and Y.<a href=#>[note 10]</a></p>Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!<p>Although <a href=# title="Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!">Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!</a> are remakes of Pokémon Yellow, <a href=# title="Red (game)">Red</a> and <a href=# title="Blue (game)">Blue</a> are known to have already finished their journeys years ago, and <a href=# title=Mina>Mina</a>'s age mentioned in her concept art would suggest that the games are set a maximum of six years before Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon,<a href=#>[4]</a><a href=#>[note 11]</a> implying that they take place later than the original game. However, this is contradicted by <a href=# title=Sabrina>Sabrina</a> having a vision of meeting a special Trainer in three years, referencing the protagonist of Generation II, suggesting these games may not necessarily adhere to the timeline of the rest of the core series.</p>References to real-life years and release dates<p>The specific years of events are not mentioned in the games themselves, but Pocket Monsters Encyclopedia implies that Pokémon Red and Green take place in 1995 or 1996, the latter being the year in which they were released; this year is also referenced in Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon on Red's shirt, which features a symbol resembling the number "96". Pokémon Gold and Silver are known to occur three years later, also aligning with their release in 1999. Similarly, Pokémon Black 2 and White 2 are set two years after Pokémon Black and White, which was also the amount of time that passed between the releases of the games. References to the passage of time in real life also appear in Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, in which the player's <a href=# title="Mom (Hoenn)">mother</a> states that she saw the <a href=# title=Litleonids>Litleonids</a> when they last occurred 12 (in the Japanese and Korean versions) or 11 (in the English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish versions) years ago, referencing the time between the release of Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire and their remakes, and <a href=# title=Norman>Norman</a> mentions having seen the <a href=# title="Eon Ticket">Eon Ticket</a> 11 years ago, referencing how long had passed from the item's original distribution in 2003 to the release of the games. Similarly, in Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, Brilliant Diamond, and Shining Pearl, the description of the <a href=# title="Member Card">Member Card</a> mentions that the last date marked on it was 50 years ago; the date shown on the card's official artwork (1958.12.1) is exactly 50 years prior to its first distribution.</p>Alternate universes<p>The existence of <a href=# title="Pokémon multiverse">multiple alternate universes</a> is alluded to or stated in some of the games.</p><h3><span id=Beginning_of_the_Pok.C3.A9mon_universe></span><span class=mw-headline id=Beginning_of_the_Pokémon_universe>Beginning of the <a href=# title="Pokémon universe">Pokémon universe</a></span></h3><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/8/88/Kyogre_Groudon_legend.png/375px-Kyogre_Groudon_legend.png decoding=async width=250 height=538 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> The clash between Groudon and Kyogre as depicted in ancient paintings<p>This information is based primarily on <a href=# title="Sinnoh myths">the mythology</a> of both the <a href=# title=Hoenn>Hoenn</a> and <a href=# title=Sinnoh>Sinnoh</a> regions.</p><ul><li>In a vortex of complete chaos and nothingness, a single <a href=# title="Pokémon Egg">Egg</a> comes into being, which then hatches into <a href=# title="Arceus (Pokémon)">Arceus</a>, the first being in existence.
