Rison played for various teams during his professional football career, including the Indianapolis Colts, Atlanta Falcons, Cleveland Browns, Jacksonville Jaguars, Green Bay Packers, Kansas City Chiefs, Oakland Raiders, and the CFL’s Toronto Argonauts.</p><p>Despite earning over $20 million from salary and endorsements, Rison is an unfortunate example of a professional athlete who went broke after retiring. He lived beyond his means for many years and found himself flat broke. At the peak of his career, Rison would travel with an entourage of 40-50 people, just one example of his lavish spending.</p><p>Rison is also known for his relationship with the late singer Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes, a member of the pop group TLC. In 1994, Lopes infamously burnt Rison’s $800,000 Atlanta mansion to the ground. The couple dated from 1993 until 2001, one year before Lopes’ tragic death.</p><h2></h2><p>Andre Rison was born in Flint, Michigan, in 1967. He played football at Flint Northwestern High School before continuing his career at Michigan State University, where he earned multiple awards and honors.</p><h2><span id=Andre_Risons_Career_in_the_NFL_and_CFL>Andre Rison’s Career in the NFL and CFL</span></h2><p>Andre Rison was drafted by the Indianapolis Colts in 1989 and caught 52 passes for 820 yards and four touchdowns during his rookie season. He was then traded to the Atlanta Falcons, where he spent five seasons and achieved 15 receiving touchdowns in 1993, topping all NFL players that year. Rison moved on to the Cleveland Browns in 1995 and had a personal career low, with only 47 receptions, 701 yards, and three touchdowns. He briefly played for the Jacksonville Jaguars before joining the Green Bay Packers in 1996 and winning his first Super Bowl. Rison signed with the Kansas City Chiefs in 1997 and helped the team make it to the Pro Bowl in his first year, but performed less well during his second season with them. Rison finished his NFL career with the Oakland Raiders in 2000, with 743 receptions for 10,205 yards and 84 touchdowns, 8 kickoff returns for 150 yards, and 9 carries for 23 yards.</p><p>After a brief hiatus, Rison returned to football in 2004 when he signed with the Toronto Argonauts in the Canadian Football League. He helped the team win the Grey Cup championship that year, but was released by the team in August 2005.</p><h2><span id=Coaching_and_Training_Career>Coaching and Training Career</span></h2><p>After retiring from professional football, Andre Rison turned to coaching. He worked as an assistant coach at Beecher High School in Flint, Michigan from 2006-2008. In March 2010, he became the head coach for the football team at Flint Northwestern High School. He left this position in May 2012 to finish his college degree at Michigan State and join the football team as an assistant coach.</p><p>Rison also founded the Andre Rison Football Academy, where he works as a trainer for wide receivers.</p><h2><span id=Andre_Risons_Nicknames_and_Family>Andre Rison’s Nicknames and Family</span></h2><p>Andre Rison was given the nickname “Bad Moon” by ESPN sportscaster Chris Berman, alluding to the Creedence Clearwater Revival song “Bad Moon Rising”, due to his off-field behavior. During his time with the Kansas City team, he also became known as “Spider-Man” for his habit of faking a web-shooting gesture after scoring a touchdown. Rison has a son named Hunter Rison, who followed in his father’s footsteps and played football. Hunter played as a wide receiver at Michigan State University as a true freshman in 2017, before transferring to Kansas State University in 2018.</p><h2><span id=Andre_Risons_Rocky_Relationship_with_Lisa_Lopes>Andre Rison’s Rocky Relationship with Lisa Lopes</span></h2><p>From 1993 to 2001, Andre Rison had an on and off relationship with TLC singer Lisa Lopes. Their relationship was plagued by multiple instances of domestic violence allegations.</p><p>An infamous altercation occurred in 1994 when Lisa set several of Andre’s shoes on fire in a bathtub after he and his friends returned from a night of partying at 6:30 am. The fire spread and burned down the entire house, which Rison had purchased two years earlier for $861,000. The home featured seven bedrooms, six fireplaces, and a recording studio.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunCtzZ2pnmWinsCwuoynnK1lp6S%2FtbSO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./llano-in-the-wild-toshibas-satellite-l775ds7206.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bringing Gaming to the Masses">&larr;
