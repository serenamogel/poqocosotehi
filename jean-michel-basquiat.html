He sold sweatshirts and postcards featuring his artwork on the streets before his painting career took off. He collaborated with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/artists/andy-warhol data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Andy Warhol" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Andy Warhol</a> in the mid-1980s, which resulted in a show of their work. Basquiat died on August 12, 1988, in New York City.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Basquiat was born in Brooklyn, New York, on December 22, 1960. With a Haitian-American father and a Puerto Rican mother, Basquiat's diverse cultural heritage was one of his many sources of inspiration.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A self-taught artist, Basquiat began drawing at an early age on sheets of paper his father, an accountant, brought home from the office. As he delved deeper into his creative side, his mother strongly encouraged him to pursue his artistic talents.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Basquiat first attracted attention for his graffiti in New York City in the late 1970s, under the name "SAMO." Working with a close friend, he tagged subway trains and Manhattan buildings with cryptic aphorisms.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1977 Basquiat quit high school a year before he was slated to graduate. To make ends meet, he sold sweatshirts and postcards featuring his artwork on the streets of his native New York.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Crown Motif</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In his earlier works, Basquiat was known for using a crown motif, which was his way of celebrating Black people as majestic royalty or deeming them as saints.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Describing the crown itself in further detail, artist Francesco Clemente posited: "Jean-Michel’s crown has three peaks, for his three royal lineages: the poet, the musician, the great boxing champion. Jean measured his skill against all he deemed strong, without prejudice as to their taste or age."</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Paintings</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Three years of struggle gave way to fame in 1980 when Basquiat's work was featured in a group show. His work and style received critical acclaim for the fusion of words, symbols, stick figures, and animals. Soon, his paintings came to be adored by an art-loving public that had no problem paying as much as $50,000 for a Basquiat original.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His rise coincided with the emergence of a new art movement, Neo-Expressionism, ushering in a wave of new, young and experimental artists that included Julian Schnabel and Susan Rothenberg.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2017, a Japanese billionaire broke a record when he bought Basquiat's “Untitled,” a 1982 painting of a skull, for $110.5 million at a Sotheby’s auction.</p><img alt="Basquiat Photo" title="Basquiat Photo" width=4075 height=2987 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/the27club-basquiat-jean-michel-raw.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Getty Images</span><p>Jean-Michel Basquiat</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Basquiat and Warhol</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the mid-1980s, Basquiat collaborated with famed pop artist Warhol, which resulted in a show of their work that featured a series of corporate logos and cartoon characters.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On his own, Basquiat continued to exhibit around the country and the world. In 1986, he traveled to Africa for a show in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. That same year, the 25-year-old exhibited nearly 60 paintings at the Kestner-Gesellschaft Gallery in Hanover, Germany — becoming the youngest artist to ever showcase his work there.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Personal Problems</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As his popularity soared, so did Basquiat's personal problems. By the mid-1980s, friends became increasingly concerned by his excessive drug use. He became paranoid and isolated himself from the world around him for long stretches. Desperate to kick a heroin addiction, he left New York for Hawaii in 1988, returning a few months later and claiming to be sober.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Sadly, he wasn't. Basquiat died of a drug overdose on August 12, 1988, in New York City. He was 27 years old. Although his art career was brief, Basquiat has been credited with bringing the African American and Latino experience into the elite art world.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After his death, the artist was back in the spotlight in May 2017 when a Japanese billionaire bought “Untitled,” a 1982 painting of a skull, for $110.5 million at a Sotheby’s auction. The sale set a record for the highest price for a work by an American artist and for an artwork created after 1980. It was also the highest price for a painting by Basquiat and by a Black artist.</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Basquiat died of a drug overdose on August 12, 1988, in New York City. He was 27 years old.</p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Movie</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Directed by Schnabel, the biographical indie film entitled Basquiat was released in 1996, which starred Jeffrey Wright in the title role and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/david-bowie data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="David Bowie" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">David Bowie</a> as Warhol, among its star-studded cast.</p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10"></h2><ul data-node-id=34 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Birth Year: 1960</li><li>Birth date: December 22, 1960</li><li>Birth State: New York</li><li>Birth City: Brooklyn</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Jean-Michel Basquiat was a Neo-Expressionist painter in the 1980s.
