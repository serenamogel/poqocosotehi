In the early 1500s, Spanish conquerors found the Incas growing the vegetable, which the Spanish called patata. They were taken back to Europe and eventually reached England where the name changed to potato.</span></span><h2>Are potatoes originally from Ireland?</h2>However, the potato was not a native of Ireland. It had been found by Spanish conquistadors in south America in the 1500s was shipped to Europe, and reached Ireland around 1590. For the next 80 years it was grown in small numbers, mainly in Munster, as a garden crop or stand-by.<h2>Why is Ireland associated with potatoes?</h2>Why were potatoes so important to Ireland? The potato plant was hardy, nutritious, calorie-dense, and easy to grow in Irish soil. By the time of the famine, nearly half of Ireland's population relied almost exclusively on potatoes for their diet, and the other half ate potatoes frequently.<h2>Is Irish and potato the same thing?</h2>A name used to refer to different varieties of white potatoes. Potatoes were a major crop in Ireland and were brought to New England by the Irish immigrants in the beginning of the 18th century.

Most red varieties store longer than do white varieties; on the other hand, most white varieties have better cooking qualities than red varieties. Many gardeners plant some of each in the spring. The whites are used first and the reds stored for later use.<h2>Which continent are potatoes native to?</h2>Potatoes were domesticated there approximately 7,000–10,000 years ago, from a species in the Solanum brevicaule complex. In the Andes region of South America, where the species is indigenous, some close relatives of the potato are cultivated.<h2>What is a traditional Irish dish?</h2>Representative dishes include Irish stew, bacon and cabbage, boxty, soda bread (predominantly in Ulster), coddle, and colcannon. Modern Irish food still uses traditional ingredients, but they are now being cooked by chefs with world influences and are presented in a more modern and artistic style.<h2>What food is Ireland known for?</h2><p>Don't leave Ireland without trying...</p><ul><li>Soda bread.

They were not widely grown for almost a century until 1719, when they were planted in Londonderry, New Hampshire, by Scotch-Irish immigrants, and from there spread across the nation.<h2>What did they eat in Ireland before potatoes?</h2>Grains, either as bread or porridge, were the other mainstay of the pre-potato Irish diet, and the most common was the humble oat, usually made into oatcakes and griddled (ovens hadn't really taken off yet).<h2>Is Ireland famous for potatoes?</h2>To this day, the potato has remained a staple of the Irish diet. Whether it be mashed, roasted, sautéed, or even added to a stew, you are in fact very likely to find it somewhere on your plate in an Irish household.<h2>Are potatoes indigenous to Europe?</h2>Originating from the highlands of the Andes, South America, potatoes were introduced to Europe in the sixteenth century.

He brought them back to England and they have been a mainstay in British diets ever since.<h2>Does Ireland grow potatoes?</h2>Potatoes grown in Ireland can be broken down into four main growing types: Early Potatoes, Main Crop Potatoes, Seed Potatoes and Salad Potatoes.
