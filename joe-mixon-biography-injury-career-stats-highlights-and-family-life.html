ranking websites.&nbsp;However, after a series of debates and questions about his character, he was selected in the second round of the 2017 NFL draft by the Cincinnati Bengals.&nbsp;Through June 2017, he signed a 4-year contract with the Bengals worth $5.45M with a $2.81M guarantee and a $2.10M signing bonus.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Joe Mixon’s biography</span></strong></h2><p><span>He was born in Oakley, San Francisco, California on July 24, 1996 to Alise and John Mixon and he has five siblings.&nbsp;The talented young man played both basketball and football in his high school.</span></p><p><span>Joe Mixon received his high school education at Freedom High School.&nbsp;He spent 3 years with the Falcons as a starter and did a wonderful job.&nbsp;In his junior year, he amassed 1,443 rushing yards and 21 touchdowns on 201 carries and gracefully finished his senior year with 1,704 rushing yards and 23 touchdowns on 226 carries.</span></p><p><span>His basketball prowess did not disappoint as he averaged 12.2 PPG and a 57% free throw percentage, which meant 79 field goals in all 19 games he participated in.&nbsp;His contributions saw his team go 22-2 overall and win 10-0 in the league that season.</span></p><p><span>Upon graduation, he was courted by 47 colleges including UCLA, Alabama, etc. from which he selected Oklahoma University and played for the Oklahoma Sooners.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Career highlights,&nbsp;</span></strong><span>stats, injury</span></h2><p><span>Mixon’s stint with the Oklahoma Sooners has begunJoe Mixon was beaten on camera by Amelia Molitor, resulting in the team’s one-year suspension.&nbsp;When he came back the next season, he had a 76-yard touchdown reception that ranks as one of the longest ever caught by a freshman running back for the Sooners.</span></p><p><span>He went on to record his highest score ever for The Sooners with 31 bringing 263 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns, with 4 receptions for 114 receiving yards and 3 receiving touchdowns he earned in the game against Texas Tech.&nbsp;He also contributed to his team’s victory in the Sugar Bowl, with 91 rushing yards, two rushing touchdowns, five receptions and 89 yards in the game against Auburn.</span></p><p><span>Professionally, Joe Mixon was drafted 48th overall in the 2nd round of the 2017 NFL draft, despite not initially receiving an invitation to the combine from the NFL.&nbsp;The Bengals arranged his combine tests and then offered him a deal with the team.&nbsp;Due to heated debates over his recruitment, he only played 14 games, 7 of which started with rushing for 626 yards, 4 touchdowns and 30 pass receptions for 287 yards, with 3 recovering from forced fumbles and 2 losing his first season record with the team.</span></p><p><span>In 2018, despite his injuries, he was able to record 179 yards in rushes, 1 touchdown, 6 receptions in 2 games played.&nbsp;The running back player is worth an estimated $2 million with an annual salary of $1.36 million.</span></p><h2><strong><span>family life</span></strong></h2><p><span>Joe Mixon revealed in an interview that he was a single parent of a single mother, Alisa Smith, and that he had two brothers and three sisters who looked up to him.&nbsp;There aren’t many details about his entire family as he rarely talks much about his background and family.&nbsp;He is not in any known relationship at the moment.&nbsp;He appears to be focused on his career and rebuilding his already battered image, which has been tarnished by bad publicity, led to his physical injury.</span></p><h2><strong><span>height and weight</span></strong></h2><p><span>Joe Mixon has the frame, construction and projectionelite attribute of a returning NFL.&nbsp;He stands at 6ft 1in and has a weight of 100kg which allows him to glide smoothly through the backcourt.&nbsp;A style that has drawn some comparisons to players like Le’Veon Andrew Bell running back for Pittsburgh Steelers.</span></p><h2><strong><span>More facts about Joe Mixon</span></strong></h2><p><span>The young talent stepped in after pleading guilty to assault by wife Amelia Roe Molitor in July 2016.&nbsp;The event took place on July 25, 2014 – the day after his 18th birthday – at a restaurant in Norman, Oklahoma.&nbsp;He was caught on camera in a heated argument with Molitor, which prompted her to punch him.&nbsp;And in retaliation, Joe Mixon hit her head and slammed her face on a table, resulting in broken jawbones, for which the young lady underwent corrective surgery.</span></p><p><span>He was serving a one-year sentence of 100 hours of community service and was made to undergo behavioral counseling sessions.&nbsp;He was fined $1,200 and suspended for an entire football season.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><span class=vce-square></span><h2 class=entry-title><a href=# title="Who is Liam Costner?
