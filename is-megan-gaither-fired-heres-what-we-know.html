This is the second time a teacher from the same school has been caught selling explicit content on the adult entertainment website. The news has sparked controversy and raised questions about the school’s policies on teachers’ side hustles.</p><p>Gaither’s OnlyFans account was discovered by a student who shared it on social media. The post went viral, and the school authorities were quick to take action by putting her on leave. However, Gaither has expressed her desire to return to the classroom and continue teaching. She claims that she was using OnlyFans to supplement her income and that it was a private matter that did not affect her teaching abilities.</p><p>The incident has raised questions about the school’s policies on teachers’ side hustles and whether they should be allowed to engage in such activities. While some argue that teachers should have the right to pursue other interests and earn extra income, others believe that such activities can negatively impact their professional image and affect their ability to teach effectively. The controversy has also sparked a debate about the use of social media by teachers and the need for schools to have clear guidelines on the matter.</p><h2><span id=Is_Megan_Gaither_Fired>Is Megan Gaither Fired?</span></h2><h3><span id=Details_of_the_Incident>Details of the Incident</span></h3><p>Megan Gaither, a 31-year-old English teacher and varsity cheerleading coach at St. Clair High School, was placed on leave last week after her OnlyFans account was discovered. According to <a href=# rel=noopener>New York Post</a>, Gaither was put on leave by the district on Friday evening, and she expects to be fired after going public.</p><p>Gaither started her OnlyFans account in 2020, where she posted explicit photos and videos of herself. She has over 100,000 followers on the platform, and her content is available for a subscription fee.</p><p>Gaither’s case is the second instance of a teacher being suspended from the same Missouri high school over their OnlyFans account. The first teacher, Tiffany Shepherd, was suspended earlier this month after her account was discovered.</p><h3><span id=Public_Reaction>Public Reaction</span></h3><p>The news of Megan Gaither’s suspension has sparked a lot of controversy and debate. Some people believe that her personal life should not affect her job as a teacher, while others argue that her behavior is inappropriate and goes against the values of the school.</p><p>Many of Gaither’s supporters have taken to social media to express their support for her. They argue that she has every right to do what she wants with her body, and that her OnlyFans account is a form of empowerment.</p><p>On the other hand, some people have criticized Gaither for her behavior, arguing that it is unprofessional and sets a bad example for her students. They argue that teachers should be held to a higher standard of behavior, and that Gaither’s actions are unacceptable.</p><p>Overall, the situation with Megan Gaither is still unfolding, and it remains to be seen whether or not she will be fired from her job as a teacher.</p><h2><span id=Missouri_Teacher_Instagram_And_Pictures>Missouri Teacher Instagram And Pictures</span></h2><h3><span id=Social_Media_Presence>Social Media Presence</span></h3><p>Megan Gaither, a 31-year-old English teacher and varsity cheerleading coach at St. Clair High School in Missouri, has a social media presence on various platforms.

The incident has raised questions about the appropriateness of teachers engaging in such activities and the impact it may have on their students.</p><p>While some may argue that teachers have the right to engage in any legal activity to supplement their income, others may argue that such activities are not in line with the values and standards expected of educators.
