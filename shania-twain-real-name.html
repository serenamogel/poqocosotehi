I Fell Like A Woman!” and “You’re Still The One,” two of her mega-hits. Her huge power move in “That Don’t Impress Me Much,” in which she mentions <a href=#>Brad Pitt</a> and claims that even the A-list actor must have substance in order to meet her standards, is still remembered as a classic karaoke moment.</p><p>Twain took a vacation after giving birth to her son, Eja, in 2001 (according to People), not realizing that the break would last for years. Nevertheless, Twain is still active in the music business. Even though it’s challenging to top career highs like “Up!” Twain continues to release new albums. Her first studio album since 2002, “Now,” was released in 2017, and she has a brand-new album, “Queen of Me,” which was released earlier in February 2023. Twain also takes fashion risks, as evidenced by her outrageous Grammys 2023 ensemble. However, she enjoys it all!</p><p>Twain has had a relatively lengthy and prosperous career, whether with crowd-pleasing, exuberant tunes or heartfelt ballads. But “Shania” Twain wasn’t always the same. Like so many other famous people, the singer goes by a stage name, but why did she decide to change it?</p><h3>Shania Twain wanted a stage name that wasn’t her grandmother’s</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/shania-twain-wanted-a-stage-name-that-wasnt-her-grandmothers-1675981127.jpg alt="shania twain net worth,is shania twain deaf,shania twain siblings today,shania twain son,shania twain biological father,is shania twain still married to frederic thiebaud,how old is shania twain daughter,shania twain now,shania twain children,why did shania twain change her name,shania twain age,is shania twain married,is shania twain&amp;#039;s real name eileen,is shania twain her real name,shania twain worth 2020,whats shania twain real name,shania twain nett worth,shania twain how much is she worth" width=780 height=438 sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Many famous people and musicians came from modest backgrounds; not all of them had lives of luxury. And Shania Twain, whose life hasn’t exactly been smooth, can attest to the fact that. She lived in poverty as a child and revealed to Rolling Stone in 1998 that she frequently went to school hungry. She doesn’t regret anything and has learned how to adjust in ways that many children who experience trauma or poverty must. Twain was actually born Eilleen Regina Edwards and was not known as “Shania” throughout all of those anxieties and difficult years. She assumed the surname “Twain” after being raised by her stepfather Jerry Twain, whom she considered to be her real father, according to Smooth Radio.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u24556e43d2ba31da18f08d8c297ad830><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Meet Eja Lange, Shania Twain's Son - Everything You Need To Know About Him</span></a><p>Twain stated that it’s common for celebrities to go by a different name than the one they were given when discussing her stage name on her Apple Music Hits program, “Home Now Radio,” in 2021 (via PopCulture). She sought a stage name that “sounded a little less like my grandmother’s name” because she was named after both of her grandmothers, Eilleen and Regina. Shania was the ideal match for her. The Canadian singer claimed, “I met someone with the name Shania, thought it was beautiful, and Shania Twain was born.</p><h3>Shania Twain has a sweet relationship with her two selves</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/shania-twain-has-a-sweet-relationship-with-her-two-selves-1675981127.jpg alt="shania twain net worth,is shania twain deaf,shania twain siblings today,shania twain son,shania twain biological father,is shania twain still married to frederic thiebaud,how old is shania twain daughter,shania twain now,shania twain children,why did shania twain change her name,shania twain age,is shania twain married,is shania twain&amp;#039;s real name eileen,is shania twain her real name,shania twain worth 2020,whats shania twain real name,shania twain nett worth,shania twain how much is she worth" width=780 height=438 sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>For the sake of show business, it could be a little perplexing to be referred to by a name that you weren’t given at birth. However, Shania Twain still considers “Eilleen” and “Shania” to be part of her “relationship.” She said to The Guardian in 2018 that she views both names as representing different aspects of herself. “I use the phrase “Come on, Eilleen!” when I talk to myself.” They aren’t that unlike from one another, she argues. However, “Shania” is the polished, charismatic face while “Eilleen” is more of a tomboy.</p><p>Twain claims that she has always been really timid, despite <a href=#>the flash</a> and glamour and her song “That don’t impress me much” about the men surrounding her. “I’m an introvert. I enjoy being alone, “Telling The Guardian, Twain. “I was enthusiastic as a teenager, but in a bothersome way. I was called “spaz” by some. No flattery was intended. It was somewhat upsetting.” After being bullied as a shy teenager, the victim is now among the most well-known musicians in the world. She has Lyme illness, which has made her sicker than she previously disclosed, but she still plans to tour in 2023 to support her new record, according to Rolling Stone.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt="shania twain net worth,is shania twain deaf,shania twain siblings today,shania twain son,shania twain biological father,is shania twain still married to frederic thiebaud,how old is shania twain daughter,shania twain now,shania twain children,why did shania twain change her name,shania twain age,is shania twain married,is shania twain's real name eileen,is shania twain her real name,shania twain worth 2020,whats shania twain real name,shania twain nett worth,shania twain how much is she worth" itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
