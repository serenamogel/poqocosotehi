Ashley Morrill approached his sister, her husband, and their other crew members Jared and Matt after becoming aware of the situation.</p><p>It was the month of January, and everyone thought Chase’s suggestion had to be a joke. However, after some deliberation, they all agreed on the concept and agreed to be interviewed.</p><p>Ashley Morrill and her family were on Skype with the producers when one thing led to another. As far as anyone can tell, the meeting went well, and the pilot episode was shot in early spring 2015.</p><p>Maine Cabin Masters is still one of the most popular shows on television, with millions of viewers.
