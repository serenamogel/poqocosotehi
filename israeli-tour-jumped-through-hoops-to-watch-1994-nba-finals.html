But together, in 1994, they watched Game 7 of the Knicks-Rockets NBA Finals and remain bound by that game as no others.</p><p>There were 70 of them, two busloads of teens from Houston, on a tour of Israel.</p><p>On June 22, the night Game 7 was played in Houston, they not only were eight hours ahead of Houston, they were in an isolated Bedouin encampment — a Bedouin & Breakfast — near the Jordanian border. Even in the Holy Land, their chance to watch the Rockets win Houston’s first NBA championship — it would start at 4 a.m. for them — was a longer shot than David over Goliath.</p><p>And their Texas-accented disappointment and cursed bad timing could be heard throughout Buses 1 and 2.</p><p>That’s when their two young Israeli tour guides, Reuven Zusman and Yoram Preminger, went to work. They began inquiries in search of someone — anyone — in this Negev Desert region who had an oasis, in this case, cable TV.</p><p>They found one by phone, a cafe owner in the town of Dimona, 22 miles from the Dead Sea.</p><p>“We told him,” said Zusman, now, for good reason, among Israel’s most coveted guides among Christians and Jews — and a friend to Arab restaurateurs throughout the country — “that if he opened for us we might make it worth his while. ‘You sell soda, candy, snacks, ice cream?’ ‘I do.’ ‘Would you open if I brought you 70 kids, 16 and 17 years old?’ ‘I would.’ ‘OK, we’ll see you around 3 a.m.’ ”</p><p>And so with the promise of milk and honey, the deal was struck.</p><p>“At that point we didn’t even know if his cable TV would have the basketball game,” Zusman said. “But it was worth a try. And the kids, boys and girls, were eager to add adventure to their adventure. We had nothing to lose but sleep.”</p><p>So at about 2:30 a.m., 70 kids headed for an “after-hours club.” And when the owner ran his one TV set through the dial, Hallelujah! There it was — NBC! Soon, at 4 a.m., Marv Albert and Matt Guokas would narrate the Rockets’ 90-84 championship win.</p><p>“Perhaps the only one more happy than those kids was the cafe owner,” Zusman said. “I doubt he knew what he was watching, but he’ll never forget that game, either.”</p><p>So then it was back to the Bedouin encampment — but only in time for some breakfast and to reboard the buses to head for their next historic site or modern desert marvel.</p><p>“I stood up in the front of my bus to tell them what we would next visit,” Zusman said. “But then I sat back down. They were all asleep.”</p><p>There’s a lot to remember about those 1994 Finals. Game 5 on NBC was preceded here that day by a parade for the Rangers having finally entered the Promised Land — winning the Stanley Cup.</p><p>That night’s Knicks’ win in the Garden was pre-empted by NBC’s coverage of the slow-speed chase of ex-NBC Sports commentator O.J. Simpson.</p><p>But 70 kids from Houston watched Game 7 — the one that won it for their team — from the other side of the world, on the other side of the next day, from a side-of-the-road cafe somewhere beside the birth of recorded civilization. Seek and ye shall find.</p><p>Phil Mushnick’s column returns June 15.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlfnl7j29maWpfnsCzrcSloGasn6q%2FbrbUpqeenF2ptbO71KCfZqCfpL20edOoZLCZpJi1bn2YcmtmppKWeqe1zZqjrGc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./189547-steve-harvey-wife-marjorie-share-beautif-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Steve Harvey and Wife Marjorie Share Beautiful Photos of Lori as They Celebrate Her 23rd Birthday">&larr;
