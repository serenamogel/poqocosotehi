Although Wanda has lived her life in the spotlight in the last decade, the same can’t be said of her <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.romper.com/p/who-is-wanda-sykes-wife-alex-niedbalski-gets-some-airtime-in-her-new-netflix-special-17903308>beautiful wife</a>, who isn’t as famous.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/5737e46f0b23bcab1a59d8b853b7fd43.jpg><p class=xj data-testid=image-source>Wanda Sykes at Point Honors Los Angeles 2017, benefiting Point Foundation, at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on October 7, 2017 in Beverly Hills, California | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=fh><strong class=dh>WHO IS ALEX SYKES?</strong></p><p class=fh>Wanda’s wife, Alex Sykes, nee Nieldbaski, is a French woman who prefers keeping her life <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CSSig1YJsGU/>private</a>. She <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thethings.com/who-is-wanda-sykes-wife-alex-niedbalski-and-what-does-she-do/>worked</a> as an interior designer and countertop salesperson before meeting the actress.</p><p class=fh>Given the couple’s penchant for keeping their lives private, little is known about Alex’s career since becoming a spouse to the famous actress. Notably, Alex is also a mom, having welcomed Wanda’s twins, Olivia and Luca, in 2009.</p><p class=fh><strong class=dh>HOW THEY MET</strong></p><p class=fh>Wanda and Alex first met in 2006, thanks to the latter’s job as a kitchen designer. Wanda once opened up about the onset of their <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B8lvrylBq4U/>love story</a>, admitting she felt an instant connection right after seeing her future wife for the first time.</p><p class=fh>She first spotted her on a ferry to Fire Island, squatting to talk to a little boy. At that instant, something told her that Alex was just what she needed, Wanda recalled.</p><p class=fh>To further prove they were fated to be together, they finally got to meet days later, after the actress told an acquaintance about her plans to remodel her kitchen. The woman immediately recommended a good kitchen designer, who turned out to be Alex.</p><p class=fh><strong class=dh>THEIR MARRIAGE</strong></p><p class=fh>Following their first meeting, the two women, who were single at the time, hit it off instantly. They dated for two years before eventually mustering the courage to <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.purewow.com/entertainment/wanda-sykes-wife>tie the knot</a> in October 2008.</p><p class=fh>The pair have remained the ultimate sweethearts and the best of friends, utilizing all available opportunities to celebrate their love.</p><p class=fh>While commemorating their twelfth anniversary, Wanda <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CGybXwNFbZj/>penned</a> a heartfelt tribute to her other half on Instagram, reflecting on their then twelve-year journey. She accompanied the post with a photo from their wedding day.</p><p class=fh><strong class=dh>COMING OUT</strong></p><p class=fh>A month after exchanging vows with her woman, the “Black-ish” star <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instyle.com/celebrity/wanda-sykes-wife-pride-essay>outed</a> her lesbian status during a same-sex marriage rally in Las Vegas.</p><p class=fh>Before coming out as a lesbian, all Wanda’s friends and close acquaintances knew about her sexuality. However, coming out to the world and having it make headlines on news channels like CNN hit differently.</p><p class=fh>The star, who was previously married to producer Dave Hall, also <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CGPcABMDa8A/>admitted</a> she only let her conservative parents in on her sexual preference at the age of forty. Although they were upset at first, her parents eventually came around, reconciling with her after years of estrangement.</p><p class=fh><strong class=dh>BECOMING MOMS</strong></p><p class=fh>Barely one year after tying the knot, Wanda and Alex scaled another milestone in their love life, becoming parents.</p><p class=fh>A rep of the couple <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/wanda-sykes-becomes-mom-of-twins/>confirmed</a> that Alex delivered the fraternal twins on April 27, 2009. The additions made the <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B7PJ4mMlqL1/>lovebirds</a> first-time parents. The duo remains Alex and Wanda’s only kids to date.</p><p class=fh><strong class=dh>WANDA ON MOTHERHOOD</strong></p><p class=fh>While motherhood has admittedly been a most wonderful experience for <a class="Ed a" href=#>Wanda</a>, she wasn’t always keen on becoming a mom. She once divulged that she grew up thinking she would someday become a single mom, which made her question whether or not she wanted kids in her life.</p><p class=fh>However, since meeting her spouse, the star knew she wanted nothing more. Going further, the mother-of-two admitted she and <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B2cI1IFFEq9/>her wife</a> complemented each other in more ways than one.</p><p class=fh>One of the ways they complemented each other was in their financial capabilities. Wanda explained that her French wife enjoyed traveling, which was something she could afford since she had the money to fund the trips.</p><p class=fh>Years of connecting, sharing, aligning their good hearts, and trying to always do the right thing has paid off for the couple, sustaining their marriage for fourteen years and counting.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtucW5paHq4rc2dmGarqaCytHnMmqmroZWZeqfB066pnmWdpMGpsdFmn56qXanEb7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./brother-polight-net-worth-265128.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brother Polight Net Worth 2024">&larr;
