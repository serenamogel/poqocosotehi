Aside from that, MO3 is well known for his rapping abilities, and he became one of Dallas’s most successful rappers after the release of his album Shottaz Reloaded. Aside from that, he’s had success with his hit “Hold Ya Tongue,” which has over one million views on YouTube, and his single “All The Way Down”.</h3><h2><span id=Early_Life>Early Life</span></h2><p>Melvin Noble, best known as Mo3, was born on <strong>May 31, 1992,</strong> in Dallas, Texas. He was born under the zodiac sign of Gemini and is of American nationality. He comes from a rough background, which is common among rappers. He tries not to discuss his childhood, but he has spoken of the difficulties he has faced.</p><p>After his father abandoned them, he lived with his mother, and they were often left with little or no money. They sometimes didn’t have a place to sleep and had to eat noodles or nothing at all. The two were seen sleeping on patios while having to ask inside bars and cafes if they could charge their phones. All of this struggle is what motivated he to start writing lyrics.</p><p>He was in high school but lacked books because he couldn’t afford them, and his grades were bad. His classmates made fun of him for wearing old clothing, but he didn’t let it bother him. He got a job to help his mother financially, and he finally graduated from high school. After that, he was totally focused on his rap career, and he didn’t even bother going to college.</p><h2><span id=Death>Death</span></h2><p>Mo3 was killed on <strong>November 11, 2020,</strong> at the <strong>age of 28.</strong> When driving on Interstate 35 in Dallas, he was followed by another driver. He crashed on the side of the road and tried to escape on foot before being shot in the back of the head by an unidentified gunman.</p><h2><span id=Professional_life>Professional life</span></h2><p>Mo3 was 21 years old when he released his first mixtape, “Shottaz,” in 2014. He rose in popularity in his hometown and began hanging out with other notable rappers. It took him two years to release his second mixtape, “Shottaz Reloaded,” which began his rise to stardom. With lead singles “Gagsta Love” and “Hold Ya Tongue,” it was an immediate success on the internet, with the lead singles being listened to more than 11 million times on YouTube.</p><p>Being famously changed everything for him, who was able to collaborate with his favorite rapper, Boosie, plus a handful of other artists such as Lil Ronny and Dorrough. His third mixtape, “4 Indictments,” was released in October 2016 and peaked at number 23 on the Billboard 100. The mixtape is motivational in style, and it has gained high praise from his fans.</p><p>He has three mixtapes out: “Gangsta Love, Pt.1” in February 2017, “Shottaz 3.0” in 2018, and “911: Gagsta Grillz” in February 2019. His most popular song to this day is “Errybody Not Your Friend,” which has been watched over 16 million times on YouTube.</p><p>He mostly released singles the following year, including the Aaliyah-sampling “No Feelings” and the stormy “Too Much Pride.” He worked with storied Louisiana rapper Boosie Badazz on the collaboration mixtape Badazz he in February 2020. The project went to number 136 on the Billboard 200 chart.</p><h2><span id=Achievements_and_Net_Worth>Achievements and Net Worth</span></h2><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-104448 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographymask.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mo3-net-worth.jpg alt=Mo3 width=650 height=650 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-104448 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Mo3 posing with his car and money (Source: Instagram)</p><p>When it comes to Mo3 awards and nominations, he hasn’t won them yet.
